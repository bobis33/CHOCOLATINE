  Whatever your opinions might be, this is achocolatine.But what purpose does it serve? It allows you to go through the day     and through your work better.
  In otherwords, it facilitate your work and allows you to focus on things that matter (discussing its name does notpertain to   this category).
  Your repositories are hosted on GitHub, and GitHub has an intuitive way of automating the launch of pre-defined actions,       triggered by events of your choice. It is, in the same way as chocolatines, a great way tofacilitate and enhance your         development and your workflow.
  In this project, you will setup a GitHub Actions workflow to enforce good practices and diverse rules in arepository.
  GitHub Actions are free and unlimited for public repositories, and free up to 2,000 min-utes per month for personnal private   repositories, which is quite generous!
